=========
ddr-cmdln
=========

Command-line tools for automating the Densho Digital Repository's various processes.

* kura -- Tools for creating and manipulating repository objects.
* kiroku -- Generates unique identifiers for repository objects.
* validator -- Checks repository objects for compliance with the manual.
* capsule -- Provides a RESTful interface to some/all of the above.

**ddr-local** provides a pretty front end to these tools, allowing repository contributors to manipulate collections and entities through a web interface.
**ddr-cmdln** is an embodiment of the specifications in **ddr-manual**.  In theory at least, it should be possible to replace this project with another implementation.
